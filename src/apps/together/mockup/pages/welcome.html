    <p>App name: Microscope Online</p>
    <p>Collaborative activity: worldbuilding for LARPs, RPGs, and creative writing</p>
    <p>Ideal number of users: 10 in a single game, though any number of games can be played at once</p>
    <p>Necessary skills: creativity, patience, improvisational acting, and cooperation</p>
    <p>Fun or practical: both</p>
    <p>How to see what others are doing: the player who is the 'lens' will be highlighted, as will their selection of epoch, event, or scene.  During scene creation, actions taken by each player will appear as soon as they type them into the card.</p>
    <p>How to see the most recent collaboration: after each player's turn, the card that they create appears on the board and the lens switches to the next player</p>
    <p>What can an admin see: there is no admin, every user can see everything</p>
